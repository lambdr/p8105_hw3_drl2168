I will load all necessary packages here. I also am including the code that Dr. Goldsmith showed in class, to set figure color and size preferences. I have modified it slightly: I prefer `theme_bw()` over `theme_minimal()` and I may change the color scheme from the default `viridis`.
```{r load packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)


knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

## These are options that i'm going to treat as default for now
## I don't love viridis, but don't have a better option yet
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```
